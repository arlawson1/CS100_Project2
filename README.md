# CS100_Project2

This project is designed to tell a user whether or not it is considered safe to eat food that fell on the floor.
This is accomplished via a flowchart provided by the professor.

The program asks an initial question to the user, then prompts the user for an input (what kind of food fell on the floor).
 Then, in a cycle of further questioning and prompting for input, the program will decide whether or not the user should eat
 what fell on the floor.
